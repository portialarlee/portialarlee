			<h2>1. guinea pigs & revolutionary insurrection</h2>
			<p>The Wise Guinea Pig approached and with a nonsense smile goofily spoke the following words:</p>
			<p>Dear Portia,</p>
			<p>Today is the day. Well, no, it is not the day, because no day is the day. I guess what I meant to say is that today is well, the only day, and so I do hope you move through it like a hamster in a caged wheel of life. A wheel of fortune. My dearest dear. Meaning, please linger where it is needed and please move like a spring chicken where it is needed. And please also rest when your sacred heart says I am tired. Because, the thing about it being the only day is that there is quite potentially a window of time in which you may just spin and spin and spin that dollar store wheel (while all your friends spin and spin their wheels) until the cage is no longer such a cage. For the interesting thing about those wheels you all purchased is that they turn into something else quite suddenly when a collective movement resonates through the inbetween spaces of their metallic structures. And it has something to do with it being a moment of quite a number of histories that you my dear are a part of…. I bid you luck my dearest dear.</p>
			<p>With love,</p>
			<p>The Guinea Pig (who cannot be named)</p>

			<h2>3. choosing to live in desolate, confusing, and vibrant worlds</h2>

			<p>[a bunch of fragments of thoughts about these topics from other better thinkers:]</p>

			<p>&quot;preguntando caminamos&quot;</p>

			<p>“We had been in the world for a while, image-wounded, image-lit, we talked across the tracks, we had reasons for staying, we were hunched in the metro within the great circulation, red posters hung on the walls, they seemed to announce further defeats in cryptic terms, the main feeling on the platform was hardly a feeling at all, the sensation of the circuits routing through us, it was the way of being in the world we had been offered, and not being able to name it was part of this, when we hung posters they were world posters, the images hurt or betrayed us and we did the same to them, finally we lived together in the image-world.” - from Red Posters by Joshua Clover</p>

			<p>&quot;whenever the incorruptible mother boats
			come back to you
			they return by the rivers
			where you can never wash twice&quot;
			</br>-from Mantra by Maung Thein Zaw
			</p>				

			<p>"Everything we write will be used against us. Every claim on or lament against society that we write will be received in the same way as accounts of rape—as lies. We don't care anymore. As soon as we stop resisting the charge we can turn around and face the others that have not accused us, those we should have been talking to the whole time. We name this journal after the shame we no longer feel and commemorate all these outcast comrades: the witches, crones, hysterics, spinsters, she-wolves, oracles, and misfits—our fellow travellers.</p>


			<p>See you at the gun club / dance hall / hot springs / savage blockade."</p>
			 
			<p>Portia’s rationale on why friends are good: “Because then you get to live in all of their worlds as well your own.”</p>

			<p>&quot;Adorno: Oh Habermas my dear dear friend. The protesters again! Oh they kill me slowly.  …. </p>

			<p>A voice comes from amongst the sea of students….</p>

			<p>Student 1: YOU SIR ARE A WAGNER
			 
			</br>Student 2: GOD IS DEAD, LET US ATTACK THOSE WHO HAVE REPLACED HIM WITH CHAREST
			 
			</br>Student 3: YOU CALL US LEFT WING FASCISTS? BUT IT IS YOUR POLICE STATE THAT BEATS US DOWN IN THE STREET

			</br>Student 4: ADORNO YOU ARE AN INSTITUTION AND AS AN INSTITUION, YOU ARE DEAD.&quot;</p>

			<p>&quot;But before we left, we forgot to do something
			</br>We forgot to burn the city
			</br>The city of suffering
			</br>We burnt the city and we went underground.&quot;

			<p>this is not true. once Portia didn’t let me watch Step Brothers all the way through.</p>

			<p>NB: “I believe that was me,” Anna breathed into the hot Montreal midnight wind.</p>

			<p>scene: A downtown Yangon cinema. The film is the most recent Godzilla. Seeing the film is mostly an excuse to escape the crippling heat a Yangon night, which wages war on the Celtic’s constitution. Portia’s displeasure at having to watch a movie is as thick as the night’s air.</p>

			<p>Portia [after a quick mid-movie nap, loudly, contemptuously, in a scream-whisper, but somehow with the total sincerity so central yet unique to P]: “Which one is Godzilla?”</p>

			<p>A: wondering if we could add a whole section on Portia's scream whisper</p>

			<p>“We need to get his car detailed the SECOND he gets here”</p>

			<p>We never did get to finish Date Night with Tina Fey and Steve Carrell [sic]... :(</p>

			<h2>6 and ¾. cliff bars</h2>

			<p>what does a body eat that is constantly on the verge, on a cliff? tumbling through days with pure desire to fill each crevice with the possibilities of other worlds, hunger is a thing to put sideways so you can focus on the tasks at hand. and so in a body’s hand or the hand of a body, you find a cliff bar: a bar that asks you to keep pushing with a hope for something else, some other kind of feeling, some time that awful hurt, that awful anxiety,  is not so present. somehow the cliff helps and helps help. personally, i prefer Chocolate Chip Peanut Crunch.</p>

				<p>After a night of Karaoke with a motley crew of professional journalists, NGO workers, and other reprobates, a liquor-swum Portia to a Yangon taximan:“Mahabandoula and Phone Gyi La”</p>

				<p>Yangon Taximan: &quot;5000 Kyat [5 dollars]&quot;
				L-SP: &quot;NoooooOOOOooo000000o-0o00o. 2000 Kyat&quot; [she thrusts two fingers aloft, standing her ground on swaying feet]
				YT: &quot;Go eat something&quot;
				L-SP: &quot;Ok. Thank you.&quot;</p>

				<p>assuming the middle position in a three-person shared bed, blankets snug, curled into a ball
				(phone alarm) ♫♫ Right now, right now / I can still remember when/ I was making my way back to you boy/Really gotta try/Right now, not then/I cannot remember when/ I was making my way back to you, boy/Really gotta try/This time/This time/This time♫♫ 
				Portia (whispering): Fuck, 3:30. We gotta go. We’re gonna be late. Fuck. Calling a cab. (in broken Québecois) Hello? Yes, un taxi à 3647 rue University. Merciiiiiii. (singsong voice) Wake uuuuup, time to make radioooo. First box of Timbits on me.</p>

				<h2>7.25 Portia's Sleep Ethic (and chorus of alarm clocks)</h2>

				<p>After a night of heavy drinking I wake up to the sound of an ascending, unending blackberry alarm clock. Portia. Fuck. Again. Portia has been working early morning shifts at the pool and has a habit of leaving her alarm clock for late morning obligations set. Years of classical radio going off from 7am onwards. Or worse, a blackberry left buried deep in the sheets. Today I snap.</p>

				<p>Enraged, I walk to her room and find her in a full denim outfit, mouth open, belly up on the bed. &quot;PORTIA. SHUT. YOUR. FUCKING. PHONE. OFF&quot;. I don't know what comes over me (read: still drunk). I take the battery out of the phone, whip it at her. And drop the remaining parts of the phone on her bed.</p>

				<p>Several hours later Portia stumbles into the kitchen. "It's weird, my battery fell out of my phone last night?"</p>

				<h2>*sexy eyes* ;)
				</br>7.5. actual whiskey</h2>
				<p>&quot;The People Under The Stairs</p> 

				<p>(Open on empty dive bar, sun is just beginning to leak in through grimy windows. A small door in the back of the bar opens and a lanky brunette girl in tight jeans and multiple plaids stumbles out of the bathroom. She slowly makes her way out of the bar.)</p>

				<p>Portia (to herself): What...where...oh my god.&quot;</p>

				<p>chapped lips, pupils dilated, hand moving across landscape in wiping motion: &quot;The Green of It All&quot;</p>

	    	<h2>9. The Rankin Family and Gilmore Girls</h2>

			<p>One time Portia visited my home state. It is the state (of being) which I felt had shaped my existence, the paradigms by which I shape my thought. I was happy and proud to tour her around the place. Home being, at least for me, one of the most important things. She, along with our friend Christina, seemed primarily concerned with locating the town centers, buildings, and local businesses that would most closely resemble those from Gilmore Girls, which she told me repeatedly was a carbon copy or at least a facsimile of my life. “This is my favorite record store,” I might say. “Ah yes, this is where [character] would go,” she might reply. “You are such a [so-and-so character],” it would continue.</p>

			<p>On Gilmore Girls, Nan, and Anarchists on the Television: “We should strive to have the ability to speak in multiple languages. It is worthwhile to abandon your default political discourse and attempt to mobilize someone who has been reading Margaret Wente all summer. Unfortunately, during the height of the student movement, I spent a lot of time refuting my grandma's recollection of images of  ‘violent anarchists’ she absorbed on mainstream news. … as a result of my involvement in the strike, my grandma cannot differentiate between her granddaughter and the ‘violent anarchists’ she sees on TV. Over the dinner table, we try to bridge the gap between the terminology of various activist communities and her individualistic subjectivity.These relationships humanize the movement for the outsider. We break through mainstream media constructions of the event by sharing lived political experience. Through this relationship, the viewer can perceive these politically loaded televised images within a new framework. Action, anger, movement, frustration, structural oppression, which may have existed as abstract concepts to them will become real or at least, may elicit some association. The disconnected media consumer interacts with the greater movement through knowledge transferred within an intimate relationship.</p>
