			<h2>1. guinea pigs & revolutionary insurrection</h2>
			<p>The Wise Guinea Pig approached and with a nonsense smile goofily spoke the following words:</p>
			<p>Dear Portia,</p>
			<p>Today is the day. Well, no, it is not the day, because no day is the day. I guess what I meant to say is that today is well, the only day, and so I do hope you move through it like a hamster in a caged wheel of life. A wheel of fortune. My dearest dear. Meaning, please linger where it is needed and please move like a spring chicken where it is needed. And please also rest when your sacred heart says I am tired. Because, the thing about it being the only day is that there is quite potentially a window of time in which you may just spin and spin and spin that dollar store wheel (while all your friends spin and spin their wheels) until the cage is no longer such a cage. For the interesting thing about those wheels you all purchased is that they turn into something else quite suddenly when a collective movement resonates through the inbetween spaces of their metallic structures. And it has something to do with it being a moment of quite a number of histories that you my dear are a part of…. I bid you luck my dearest dear.</p>
			<p>With love,</p>
			<p>The Guinea Pig (who cannot be named)</p>

				<h2>3. choosing to live in desolate, confusing, and vibrant worlds</h2>

				<p>[a bunch of fragments of thoughts about these topics from other better thinkers:]</p>

				<p>&quot;preguntando caminamos&quot;</p>

				<p>“We had been in the world for a while, image-wounded, image-lit, we talked across the tracks, we had reasons for staying, we were hunched in the metro within the great circulation, red posters hung on the walls, they seemed to announce further defeats in cryptic terms, the main feeling on the platform was hardly a feeling at all, the sensation of the circuits routing through us, it was the way of being in the world we had been offered, and not being able to name it was part of this, when we hung posters they were world posters, the images hurt or betrayed us and we did the same to them, finally we lived together in the image-world.” - from Red Posters by Joshua Clover</p>

				<p>&quot;whenever the incorruptible mother boats
				come back to you
				they return by the rivers
				where you can never wash twice&quot;
				</p>br>-from Mantra by Maung Thein Zaw
				</p>				

				<p>"Everything we write will be used against us. Every claim on or lament against society that we write will be received in the same way as accounts of rape—as lies. We don't care anymore. As soon as we stop resisting the charge we can turn around and face the others that have not accused us, those we should have been talking to the whole time. We name this journal after the shame we no longer feel and commemorate all these outcast comrades: the witches, crones, hysterics, spinsters, she-wolves, oracles, and misfits—our fellow travellers.</p>


				<p>See you at the gun club / dance hall / hot springs / savage blockade."</p>
				 
				<p>Portia’s rationale on why friends are good: “Because then you get to live in all of their worlds as well your own.”</p>

				<p>&quot;Adorno: Oh Habermas my dear dear friend. The protesters again! Oh they kill me slowly.  …. </p>

				<p>A voice comes from amongst the sea of students….</p>

				<p>Student 1: YOU SIR ARE A WAGNER</p>
				 
				<p>Student 2: GOD IS DEAD, LET US ATTACK THOSE WHO HAVE REPLACED HIM WITH CHAREST</p>
				 
				<p>Student 3: YOU CALL US LEFT WING FASCISTS? BUT IT IS YOUR POLICE STATE THAT BEATS US DOWN IN THE STREET</p>

				<p>Student 4: ADORNO YOU ARE AN INSTITUTION AND AS AN INSTITUION, YOU ARE DEAD.&quot;</p>

				<p>&quot;But before we left, we forgot to do something
				We forgot to burn the city
				The city of suffering
				We burnt the city and we went underground.&quot;

        	<h2>4. watching bad movies with adam sandler or will farrel in it</h2>
			<p>this is not true. once Portia didn’t let me watch Step Brothers all the way through.</p>

			<p>NB: “I believe that was me,” Anna breathed into the hot Montreal midnight wind.</p>

			<p>scene: A downtown Yangon cinema. The film is the most recent Godzilla. Seeing the film is mostly an excuse to escape the crippling heat a Yangon night, which wages war on the Celtic’s constitution. Portia’s displeasure at having to watch a movie is as thick as the night’s air.</p>

			<p>Portia [after a quick mid-movie nap, loudly, contemptuously, in a scream-whisper, but somehow with the total sincerity so central yet unique to P]: “Which one is Godzilla?”</p>

			<p>A: wondering if we could add a whole section on Portia's scream whisper</p>

			<p>“We need to get his car detailed the SECOND he gets here”</p>

			<p>We never did get to finish Date Night with Tina Fey and Steve Carrell [sic]... :(</p>

         	<h2>5. watching depressing NFB films</h2>
			<p>somewhat related: your miniature ipod shuffle containing only a handful of podcasts and Vinyl Cafe podcasts. You lived for almost two years in a country with virtually no internet and just this iPod.  if culture were like a venn diagram you are somehow the most obscure pockets...Anna says it’s not mean to call you “charmingly anachronistic”</p>


			<h2>6. falling asleep while watching anything</h2>

			<p>the beauty of eyes wide open sleeping</p>
			<p>mouth-breather extraordinaire with only the slightest rustle of a snore</p>
			<p>promises of longevity, endurance</p>

			<h2>6 and ½. wa(l)king together</h2>
			<p>why did I delete the Byron playlist?</p>



			<h2>6 and ¾. cliff bars</h2>

			<p>what does a body eat that is constantly on the verge, on a cliff? tumbling through days with pure desire to fill each crevice with the possibilities of other worlds, hunger is a thing to put sideways so you can focus on the tasks at hand. and so in a body’s hand or the hand of a body, you find a cliff bar: a bar that asks you to keep pushing with a hope for something else, some other kind of feeling, some time that awful hurt, that awful anxiety,  is not so present. somehow the cliff helps and helps help. personally, i prefer Chocolate Chip Peanut Crunch.</p>
